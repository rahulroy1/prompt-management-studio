# Prompt Management Studio

Welcome to Prompt Management Studio, a developer-native VS Code extension for professional prompt engineering. This tool provides a structured, evaluation-first workflow to help you build, test, and manage high-quality, production-ready prompts for Large Language Models.

*(A short video demonstrating the core workflow will be placed here)*

## The Goal: From Art to Engineering

Prompt engineering today is often an ad-hoc process of trial and error. This works for simple tasks, but for enterprise applications, it leads to inconsistent, hard-to-maintain, and difficult-to-evaluate prompts.

Prompt Management Studio treats prompt creation as a first-class software engineering discipline. It provides the structure and tooling necessary to move from "prompt hacking" to "prompt engineering."

## Why is This Relevant?

As organizations increasingly rely on LLMs, the need for standardized, high-quality, and governable prompts has become critical. This tool addresses several key pain points:

-   **Lack of Standardization:** Teams lack a common format for creating and sharing prompts.
-   **Difficult Evaluation:** Testing a prompt against multiple models is a manual and time-consuming process.
-   **No Version Control:** Prompts are often stored in documents or spreadsheets, disconnected from the applications that use them.
-   **Poor Reusability:** Without a structured format, reusing or adapting existing prompts is inefficient.

This extension solves these problems by providing a Git-native, IDE-centric workflow right inside VS Code.

## Key Features

-   **Structured Prompt IDE:** A custom editor for `.prompt.json` files that guides you to include a `persona`, `instructions`, `chain_of_thought` reasoning, `few-shot_examples`, and a defined `output_format`.
-   **Multi-Model Evaluation:** Select multiple models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3) and run your prompt against all of them simultaneously with a single click.
-   **Side-by-Side Comparison:** View responses from all models in a unified diff view to easily compare quality, tone, and performance.
-   **Enterprise-Ready Templates:** A library of "Golden" prompt templates for various industries (Finance, Healthcare, Logistics, etc.) to provide a high-quality starting point.
-   **Secure, Local-First Storage:** API keys are stored securely using the VS Code `SecretStorage` API. Your prompts and keys never leave your local machine.
-   **JSON Schema Validation:** Ensures all your prompts adhere to a consistent, well-defined structure.

## Getting Started

### 1. Configure API Keys
1.  Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
2.  Search for and run `Prompt Studio: Configure API Keys`.
3.  Enter your API keys for the services you wish to use (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic). These are stored securely on your local machine.

### 2. Create a New Prompt
1.  Open the Command Palette.
2.  Run `Prompt Studio: Create New Prompt`.
3.  This will create a new `new.prompt.json` file based on a starter template.
4.  The file will open in the **Prompt IDE**, which provides dedicated sections for each part of the prompt.

### 3. Editing an Existing Prompt
-   Simply open any `.prompt.json` file. The extension will automatically activate the custom Prompt IDE view.
-   Fill in the different sections:
    -   **Persona:** Define who the model should be.
    -   **Instructions:** Provide clear, step-by-step instructions.
    -   **Few-Shot Examples:** Give the model concrete examples of desired input/output.
    -   **Output Format:** Enforce a specific output structure, such as a JSON schema.

### 4. Evaluating a Prompt
1.  With a `.prompt.json` file open, you will see an "Evaluate Prompt" (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) icon in the editor's title bar.
2.  Click this button.
3.  The evaluation view will open, allowing you to select one or more models to test against.
4.  Enter any required input variables and run the evaluation.
5.  View all model responses side-by-side.
