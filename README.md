# Prompt Management Studio

## 🏗️ **Bring Engineering Discipline to Prompt Development**

The first and only VS Code extension that lets you develop, test, and manage AI prompts across ALL major providers without vendor lock-in. Transform prompt creation from chaotic copy-paste to structured, testable, version-controlled engineering practice.

**Build once, run anywhere - from your code editor.**

## 🎯 **What We're Building**

We noticed a gap in the current AI tooling landscape - most solutions either:

| Tool Category | IDE Integration | Multi-Provider Support |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| **Vendor Consoles** (Azure AI Studio, Google AI Studio, etc.) | Web-only | Single vendor |
| **Developer Libraries** (LangChain, Semantic Kernel) | Code-only | Multi-provider |
| **CLI Tools** (Promptfoo) | Terminal-based | Multi-provider |
| **Prompt Studio** | Native VS Code | Multi-provider |

**Our goal**: Combine the convenience of IDE integration with the flexibility of multi-provider support.

## 🚨 **Common Challenges We're Addressing**

Based on feedback from the developer community, we've identified several pain points:

**Workflow Disruption:**
- Switching between VS Code and web-based AI tools
- Copy-pasting prompts between different platforms
- Limited or no Git integration for prompt versioning
- Difficulty working offline or with sensitive data

**Platform Dependencies:**
- Vendor-specific formats that don't transfer between providers
- Need to learn different interfaces for each AI service
- Uncertainty about long-term access to platforms

**Development Friction:**
- Complex setup for code-based solutions
- Lack of visual tools for prompt building
- Inconsistent testing across different models

**Community Need:** A tool that integrates with existing developer workflows while maintaining flexibility.

## 🚀 **Our Solution: Best of Both Worlds**

### **💻 Native VS Code Integration**
Work where you're already productive:
- **Custom `.prompt.json` editor** with guided UI
- **IntelliSense and validation** like any code file
- **Command palette integration** for instant access
- **Git workflow native** - commit, branch, merge prompts
- **No context switching** - build and test in one place

### **🔓 Complete Vendor Freedom**
Own your prompts with provider-agnostic architecture:
- **One JSON format** works with ALL major AI providers
- **Prompt compilation engine** translates to provider-specific APIs
- **Switch providers instantly** without rewriting prompts
- **Export anywhere** - migrate to any platform anytime
- **Zero platform fees** - only pay providers for actual usage

### **⚡ Instant Multi-Model Testing**
Compare responses across providers without leaving your editor:
- OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5)
- Anthropic (Claude)
- Google (Gemini)
- Side-by-side response comparison
- Real-time cost and performance insights

## 📋 **Structured Engineering Approach**

Apply software engineering best practices to prompt development:

```json
{
  "title": "Code Review Assistant",
  "prompt": {
    "persona": {
      "role": "You are a senior software engineer with 10+ years experience",
      "expertise": "Code quality, security, and performance optimization",
      "tone": "Professional but encouraging"
    },
    "instructions": [
      "Review the provided code for potential issues",
      "Focus on security vulnerabilities and performance problems", 
      "Provide specific, actionable recommendations",
      "Explain your reasoning for each suggestion"
    ],
    "few_shot_examples": [
      {
        "input": "function add(a, b) { return a + b }",
        "analysis": "Missing input validation, no type checking",
        "output": "Consider adding parameter validation and TypeScript types..."
      }
    ],
    "chain_of_thought": [
      "First, scan for obvious syntax errors",
      "Then analyze logic and edge cases", 
      "Check for security vulnerabilities",
      "Finally, suggest performance improvements"
    ]
  },
  "user_input_template": "Review this {{language}} code:\n\n{{code}}",
  "variables": [
    {
      "name": "code",
      "type": "string",
      "required": true,
      "description": "Source code to review"
    },
    {
      "name": "language", 
      "type": "string",
      "required": true,
      "description": "Programming language (e.g., Python, JavaScript)"
    }
  ],
  "test_cases": [
    {
      "name": "SQL Injection Risk",
      "inputs": {
        "code": "query = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = \" + user_id",
        "language": "python"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Why This Structure Works:**
- 🎯 **Persona** sets clear expectations and context
- 📝 **Instructions** break down complex tasks into clear steps
- 💡 **Examples** teach the AI your preferred response style
- 🧠 **Chain-of-thought** encourages systematic reasoning
- 🔧 **Variables** make prompts reusable and testable
