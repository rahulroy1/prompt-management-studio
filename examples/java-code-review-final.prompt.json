It has several clear areas for improvement that the AI should pick up on.\n\n#### **Text box for \"Hello, how are you?\":**\n(Paste this code into the test input area)\n```java\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class DataProcessor {\n    public int process(ArrayList<String> data) {\n        int i = 0;\n        for (int j = 0; j < data.size(); j++) {\n            if (data.get(j) != null && !data.get(j).isEmpty()) {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n        return i;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhen you run this test, the AI should provide feedback pointing out things like:\n*   Using `ArrayList` instead of the more general `List` interface in the method signature.\n*   Poor variable names like `i` and `j`.\n*   The traditional `for` loop could be replaced with a more readable enhanced for-each loop.\n\nThis complete example will create a very effective and professional-looking demo.",
