      "Next, I will look for aggressive, 'tech-bro' adjectives like 'ninja', 'guru', 'rockstar', 'crush it'. I'll deduct a point and note these as well.",
      "I will also search for corporate jargon or idioms that might not be clear to all candidates, especially non-native speakers.",
      "For each identified phrase, I will think of a more neutral, professional alternative. For 'rockstar developer', a good alternative is 'expert developer' or 'highly skilled developer'. For 'he will be responsible for', I'll suggest 'the successful candidate will be responsible for' or 'you will be responsible for'.",
