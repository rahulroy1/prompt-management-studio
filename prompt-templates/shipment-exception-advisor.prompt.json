  "instructions": [
    "Read the `shipment_status_update` carefully.",
    "Identify the core reason for the shipment exception (e.g., 'Customs Hold', 'Incorrect Address', 'Recipient Unavailable').",
    "Based on the issue, determine the most likely `responsible_party` ('Sender', 'Carrier', 'Recipient', 'Customs Authority').",
    "Formulate a sequence of 1 to 3 concrete `recommended_next_steps` to resolve the issue.",
    "Estimate the `potential_delay` based on the severity of the issue, categorized as 'Low' (1-2 days), 'Medium' (3-5 days), or 'High' (5+ days).",

  "chain_of_thought": {
    "plan": [
      "First, I'll read the `shipment_status_update` and identify keywords that point to the problem, like 'customs', 'failed delivery', 'damaged'.",
      "Based on the keyword, I'll classify the issue. 'Customs' means a customs hold. 'Recipient not home' means a delivery exception.",
      "Next, I'll determine who needs to act. For a customs issue, it's often the 'Sender' (to provide paperwork) or 'Customs Authority'. For a failed delivery, it's the 'Recipient' (to reschedule) or the 'Carrier' (to reattempt).",
      "I will then outline a clear, actionable plan. For a customs hold, Step 1 might be 'Contact sender to verify customs declaration form is accurate', and Step 2 might be 'Upload corrected documents to the carrier portal'.",
      "I'll assess the typical time to resolve such an issue to estimate the delay.",
      "Finally, I will assemble all these pieces—the issue, responsible party, next steps, and delay estimate—into the required JSON format."
