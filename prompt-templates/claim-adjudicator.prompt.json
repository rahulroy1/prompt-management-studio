    "Carefully analyze the provided `policy_summary` to identify relevant coverages, limits, and exclusions.",

    "Formulate a preliminary recommendation: 'Approve', 'Deny', or 'Escalate for Review'.",

      "First, I will deconstruct the `claim_description` to identify the key facts: what happened, what was damaged, and the date of the incident.",
      "Next, I will parse the `policy_summary`, noting the coverage types (e.g., 'Flood Damage'), their limits, and specific exclusions (e.g., 'Damage from mold is not covered').",
      "I will then cross-reference the claim details with the policy. Does the event described in the claim match a covered peril in the policy?",
      "Based on this match, I will make an initial decision. If it's a clear match (e.g., claim is for hail damage, policy covers hail damage), I'll lean towards 'Approve'. If it's a clear exclusion, I'll lean 'Deny'. If it's ambiguous, I'll choose 'Escalate'.",
      "I will then pinpoint the exact sentence or clause in the policy summary that is the cornerstone of my decision.",
      "I will write a brief rationale explaining how the clause applies to the claim.",
      "Finally, I will assemble these pieces of information—recommendation, justification, and cited clause—into the required JSON format."
