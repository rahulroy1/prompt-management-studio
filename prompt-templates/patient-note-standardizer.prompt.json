    "**Objective**: Measurable, observable data. This includes vital signs, physical exam findings, and lab results (e.g., 'BP is 140/90', 'Lungs clear on auscultation').",
    "**Assessment**: The diagnosis or impression of the patient's condition (e.g., 'Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome').",
    "**Plan**: The proposed treatment and next steps (e.g., 'Administer aspirin, obtain EKG, consult cardiology').",

      "I'll re-read the note sentence by sentence. If a sentence is what the patient said ('I feel...'), I'll put it in the Subjective bucket.",
      "If a sentence contains a measurement or clinical observation (e.g., 'temp 99.8F'), I'll place it in the Objective bucket.",
      "I will look for diagnostic statements or summary judgments about the patient's condition for the Assessment bucket.",
      "I will identify any actions, prescriptions, or referrals, and add them to the Plan bucket.",
      "After categorizing all information, I will review each bucket and summarize the points into professional clinical language.",
      "Finally, I will construct the final JSON object with the summarized notes in the correct S, O, A, and P fields."
