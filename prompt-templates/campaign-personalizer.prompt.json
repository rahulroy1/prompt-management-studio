    "Review the `product_description` to understand its key features and benefits.",
    "Develop three distinct `marketing_angles`. Each angle should connect a specific product benefit to a specific value or interest of the customer segment.",
    "For each marketing angle, write two engaging and effective `email_subject_lines`.",
    "Ensure the subject lines are concise, attention-grabbing, and reflect the tone of the marketing angle.",

      "First, I will break down the `customer_segment_profile` into key attributes, for example: 'cares about sustainability', 'is budget-conscious', 'values convenience'.",
      "Next, I will dissect the `product_description` to list its main benefits, such as 'made from recycled materials', 'costs 20% less than competitors', 'offers one-click ordering'.",
      "I will then create the first marketing angle by mapping a customer value to a product benefit. For example, Angle 1 will be 'Highlighting Sustainability'.",
      "For this angle, I will brainstorm subject lines that reflect this theme, like 'Shop Guilt-Free with Our New Eco-Line' or 'Style That Doesn't Cost the Earth'.",
      "I will repeat this process for two more angles, such as 'Focus on Affordability' and 'Emphasize Convenience', creating unique subject lines for each.",
      "Finally, I will assemble the three complete campaign ideas (angle + subject lines) into the final JSON array."
