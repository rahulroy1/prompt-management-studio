  "instructions": [
    "Read the provided `contract_text` in its entirety.",
    "Scan the document specifically for clauses related to the following risk categories: 'Indemnification', 'Limitation of Liability', 'Data Privacy & Security', and 'Termination'.",
    "For each identified clause, extract the full text of the clause.",
    "Assign a `risk_level` of 'High', 'Medium', or 'Low' based on its potential impact on our organization. 'High' risk clauses are those that impose uncapped liability or severe restrictions.",
    "Provide a brief `risk_summary` explaining why the clause presents a risk.",
    "If no clauses are found for a specific category, omit it from the output.",

    "plan": [
      "First, I will read the entire `contract_text` to understand its overall purpose.",
      "I will then create a list of keywords for each risk category, e.g., for 'Indemnification', I'll search for 'indemnify', 'hold harmless', 'defend'.",
      "I will systematically scan the document for these keywords to locate relevant clauses.",
      "Once a clause is found, I will extract its full text to ensure I have the complete context.",
      "I will then analyze the language of the clause. For example, an indemnification clause that is 'mutual' might be 'Medium' risk, while a 'unilateral' one in the other party's favor is 'High' risk. A 'Limitation of Liability' clause capped at the contract value is 'Low' risk, while one that is uncapped is 'High' risk.",
      "I will then write a short summary explaining my risk assessment.",
      "I will repeat this process for all risk categories.",
      "Finally, I will assemble the findings into a JSON array, with each object representing a risky clause I identified."
